/*
Write a function called characterCount. It takes in a string and returns an object. Each key-value pair in this object represents the number of times that a character appears in the input string (the key is the character, and the value is the number of times it appeared). For example:

const inputString = "Apple sauce"
const counts = characterCount(inputString)
console.log(counts)
// {
//   A: 1,
//   p: 2,
//   l: 1,
//   e: 2,
//   ' ': 1,
//   s: 1,
//   a: 1,
//   u: 1,
//   c: 1
// }

BONUS ROUND: write a function called duplicateChars. It takes in a string and returns an array. The output array contains all the chars that appeared more than once in the input string. (No matter how many times the char appeared in the input string, it should appear once in the output array.) Use your existing characterCount function in your solution! example:
const inputString = "Apple sauce"
const counts = characterCount(inputString)
console.log(counts)
// ['p', 'e']
